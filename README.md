# **Sentiment analysis**

**Sentiment analysis**, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that identifies the emotional tone embedded within text. This methodology is widely used by organizations to evaluate and categorize public opinions regarding products, services, or concepts. It leverages data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to analyze textual data for sentiment and subjective information.

Sentiment analysis systems enable organizations to derive meaningful insights from unstructured and unorganized text originating from various online sources, such as emails, blog posts, customer support tickets, web chats, social media platforms, forums, and user comments. These systems automate data processing using rule-based, automated, or hybrid methodologies. Rule-based approaches rely on predefined lexicon-based rules to perform sentiment classification, while automated systems utilize machine learning algorithms to infer sentiment from training data. Hybrid systems combine both rule-based and automated methods to enhance performance. Beyond determining sentiment, opinion mining can extract additional information, including polarity (the degree of positivity or negativity), subjects, and opinion holders. Moreover, sentiment analysis can be conducted at various granularities, including document, paragraph, sentence, and sub-sentence levels.

## **Types of Sentiment Analysis**

Sentiment analysis can be categorized into several types based on the level of granularity and the focus of the analysis:

* **Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis**: This approach provides a detailed breakdown of sentiment polarity, typically on a scale from very positive to very negative. It mirrors the granularity of rating systems, such as a 5-star scale, offering precise insights into opinion strength.

* **Emotion Detection**: Unlike traditional polarity-focused methods, emotion detection identifies specific emotions within the text. Examples include happiness, frustration, shock, anger, and sadness, enabling a deeper understanding of emotional context.

* **Intent-Based Analysis**: This type of analysis extends beyond opinion to recognize the underlying actions or intentions within a text. For instance, a comment expressing frustration about replacing a battery may indicate a need for assistance, prompting customer service intervention to address the issue.

* **Aspect-Based Analysis**: Aspect-based sentiment analysis focuses on identifying sentiment tied to specific components or attributes of a subject. For example, a product review might mention dissatisfaction with battery life rather than the product as a whole. In such cases, the system attributes the negative sentiment specifically to the battery life aspect.

These specialized types of sentiment analysis allow for nuanced and actionable insights, tailored to different analytical needs and use cases.

In this represotory, **Emotion Detection** tasks is developed by training machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc. THe models are evaluated and performance is reported using appropriate metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
